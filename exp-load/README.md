How to run: python3 basic_mem_load.py

basic_mem_load.py: single model (VGG) testing for basic models

basic_model_load.py: time and consumption testing for basic models

db_modelload_multi_shared_parameter.py: time and memory consumption of multi-models loading in SmartLite

dl2sql: another method. See https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE53745.2022.00180
